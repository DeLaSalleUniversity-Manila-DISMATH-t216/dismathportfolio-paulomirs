# dismathportfolio-paulomirs
# week one
<ul><li> INTRODUCTION TO DISMATH </li>
<li> Basic knowledge of the subject</li>
<li> Credentials of the professor</li>
<li> i realized i need to study in advance</li>
</ul>
# week two
<ul>
<li>I learned what preposition is and how to determine them</li>
<li>new terminologies added to vocabuary like:</li>
<ul>
<li>Logical Deducton</li>
<li>Axiom</li>
</ul>
<li> i learned how to manipulate the different kinds of truth table</li>
<ul><li> Conjunction</li>
<li> Disjunction</li>
<li> Exclusive OR </li>
<li> Conditional</li>
<li> Biconditional</li>
</ul>
<li>I was introduced to Logical Equivalences and its different properties</li>
<li> i was also introduced to these "new" laws</li>
<ul>
<li>Identity Law</li>
<li>Domination Law</li>
<li>Negative and Double Negative</li>
<li>Idempotent Law</li>
<li>Commutative Law</li>
<li> De Morgan's</li>
<li>Absorption law</li>
<li>Implication</li>
</ul>
<li> I took me hours and hours before i finally understood the topic because when it is the first time I encouter these things.</li>
<li> It also took me minutes just to solve a single problem of proving.</li>
</ul>
#week three
<ul>
<li>I was introduced to the Predicate Logic</li>
<li>I realized that my life in engineering just got even harder(coming from ID 115)</li>
<li> My tools in solving proof just got updated and now have a new thing called Quantifiers</li>
<un>
<li> Universal Quantifier</li>
<li> Existential Quantifiers</li>
</un>
<li> I learned that DISMATH is not about proving, it is also disproving.</li>
<li> I was also introduced to the rules of inference</li>
<ul>
<li>Modus Ponens</li>
<li>Modus Tollens</li>
<li>Hypothetical Syllogism</li>
<li>Disjunctive Syllogism</li>
<li>Addition</li>
<li>Simplification</li>
<li>Conjunction</li>
<li>Resoluton</li>
</ul>
<li> I did not have enough sleep during this session so it took me more time to understand.</li>
</ul>
#week four
<ul>
<li>introduction to Proof</li>
<li>I was also introduced to the different kind of proofs</li>
<ul>
<li>Direct Proof</li>
<li>Contraposition</li>
<li>Vacous Proof</li>
<li>Trivial Proof</li>
<li>Contradicton</li>
<li>Proof by Equivalnces</li>
</ul>
<li> This is the part that I fully understand and now be able to Apply the things i learned from previous sessions.</li>
<li> I also searched som sample problems in the internet. I was able to solve but i still took too much time.</li>
#week five
<ul>
<li>I was introduced to Mathematical Induction.</li>
<li>Application of the methods of proving.</li>
<li>At the moment that it was being discussed, i realized that even though i studied and and become able to solve the examples I was wrong again. This topic became even more scary when the prof said that one number could use up to one whole page of yellow paper.</li>\
<li> The easy part of week 5 is the inductive definition. it is easy because it is only a definition, therefore NO PROVING.</li>
